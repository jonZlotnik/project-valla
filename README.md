# project-valla


I'm going to try to get some instructions going here to make this a proper readme file.

In the meantime, try to keep everything organized please!!

General Rules: 

If you're going to work on a new feature, a new room, a new character, start using a new kinematics script, etc. YOU MUST CREATE A NEW BRANCH AND NAME IT APPROPRIATELY!!!

Also, if you create a branch, and decide that a sub-branch is needed, or you need somebody to work on a sub-branch of your branch, you are responsible for them!

I, Jon,  will respond to your pull requests as they come up, and will be THE ONLY ONE who merges branches into master.

Thank you for cooperating.
